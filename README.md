# NBAShotChartApp
An interactive Shiny app that allows users to choose NBA players and see their shot charts for the entire 2017-2018 season, a particular game, or a combination of games. There are advanced options to allow users to refine the shots displayed on the shot chart. Shots can be restricted to particular quarters and value of the shot. The players chosen for the app were the top 25 NBA players as deemed by Sports Illustrated.

The app is currently hosted [here](http://shiny.swarthmore.edu:3838/hhan3/NBAShotChartApp/)
